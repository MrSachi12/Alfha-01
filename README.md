--------------------------------------------
WELCOME!!

I am Mr Sachchidanand 
i have a made two files in python which will help you in making a file sharing server [ for inside and outside the server ] its easy just download and run !!
## How to start the server ?
# setp 1 
download the files

# step 2
install modules if any not installed

# step 3 
mention the port on which the server will work on in main.py --> server 

# step 4
install ngrok and tunnel the localhost with port  on http not in tcp nor udp like this : ngrok http <port> to expose the port on the internet. 
the url you will get will be the server url. paste that in cleint.py

# step 5
Run it!!

## How to upload files ?
# step 1
change the server url in the code  --> cleint.py

# setp 2 
run it

cleint.py will first check that server online or not . then other works will be done
